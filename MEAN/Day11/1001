Ajax Tutorial
	AJAX allows you to send and receive data asynchronously without reloading the web page. So it is fast.

	AJAX allows you to send only important information to the server not the entire page. 
	So only valuable data from the client side is routed to the server side. 
	It makes your application interactive and faster.

Where it is used?
	There are too many web applications running on the web that are using ajax technology like gmail, facebook,twitter, google map, youtube etc.

Understanding Synchronous vs Asynchronous
	
Synchronous (Classic Web-Application Model)
	A synchronous request blocks the client until operation completes i.e. browser is unresponsive. 
	In such case, javascript engine of the browser is blocked.

Asynchronous (AJAX Web-Application Model)
	An asynchronous request doesn’t block the client i.e. browser is responsive. 
	At that time, user can perform another operations also. 
	In such case, javascript engine of the browser is not blocked.

AJAX Technologies

As describe earlier, ajax is not a technology but group of inter-related technologies. AJAX technologies includes:
	HTML/XHTML and CSS
	DOM
	XML or JSON
	XMLHttpRequest
	JavaScript

HTML/XHTML and CSS
	These technologies are used for displaying content and style. It is mainly used for presentation.

DOM
	It is used for dynamic display and interaction with data.

XML or JSON
	For carrying data to and from server. JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is like XML but short and faster than XML.

XMLHttpRequest
	For asynchronous communication between client and server. For more visit next page.

JavaScript
	Independently, it is used mainly for client-side validation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding XMLHttpRequest
	An object of XMLHttpRequest is used for asynchronous communication between client and server.

It performs following operations:
	Sends data from the client in the background
	Receives the data from the server
	Updates the webpage without reloading it.

Properties of XMLHttpRequest object
	onReadyStateChange	
	readyState	
	reponseText
	responseXML	

Methods of XMLHttpRequest object
	void open(method, URL)		
	void open(method, URL, async)	
	void open(method, URL, async, username, password)	
	void send()	
	void send(string)	
	setRequestHeader(header,value)	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How AJAX works?
	User sends a request from the UI and a javascript call goes to XMLHttpRequest object.
	HTTP Request is sent to the server by XMLHttpRequest object.
	Server interacts with the database using JSP, PHP, Servlet, ASP.net etc.
	Data is retrieved.
	Server sends XML data or JSON data to the XMLHttpRequest callback function.
	HTML and CSS data is displayed on the browser.
