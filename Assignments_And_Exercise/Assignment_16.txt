use mydata;


1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.
Ans:-
create index i_orders_onum on orders(onum);
select * from orders
group by odate;

2) If the Orders table has already been created, 
how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)?
Ans:-
We can do using the UNIQUE KEY constraint or the PRIMARY KEY constraint.
Alter table orders add unique(onum);
/*
desc orders;

select * from orders;

delete  from orders
where onum=3011;
*/

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.
Ans:-
create index i_orders_onum on orders(onum);
select odate, count(snum) from orders
group by odate;

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, 
and that this is currently the case. 
Enter a command that enforces it.

select odate, count(snum) from orders
group by odate;
